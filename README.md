## Project Summary

This project uses a real estate dataset from New Taipei City, Taiwan (2012–2013) to explore factors influencing house prices. Key variables include property age, distance to MRT stations, number of nearby convenience stores, and geographic coordinates.

The goal was to build predictive models to estimate property prices using both **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression**. Random Forest was chosen for its ability to handle outliers and non-linear relationships effectively.

## Key Points

- Data cleaned and checked for missing values and outliers.
- Visual analysis showed property prices are higher closer to MRT stations and with more nearby convenience stores.
- Random Forest achieved higher R² than Linear Regression.
- Results supported by a peer-reviewed study on house prices in Mumbai.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  
- Google Colab

## Dataset
